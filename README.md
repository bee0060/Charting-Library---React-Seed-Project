# Charting-Library---React-Seed-Project

This is a basic build of the ChartIQ library within the React framework. This provides an example of how to implement the most common elements in the library. This is not a comprehensive example, more like a good starting point for an React developer.

## Requirements

* A copy of the ChartIQ library, version 3.0+ is required. To get your copy, visit https://www.chartiq.com/products/html5-charting-library/ to see a demo and get in touch with us.

* NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/). We use NodeJS and Node Package Manager (NPM) to load the React components as well as the different libraries to transform JSX and ES6 to ES5.

## Getting started

To view the example, you will need to copy or link the ChartIQ `js` and `css` directories inside of the `chartiq` directory. To do this, execute the following commands in a terminal or command line:

### In OS X:

```
ln -s <path to extracted ChartIQ library>/js <path to React Seed project>/chartiq
ln -s <path to extracted ChartIQ library>/css <path to React Seed project>/chartiq
```
*NOTE: Use full paths, not relative paths here. (e.g. instead of "~/Documents" use "/Users/<username>/Documents"*

### In Windows:

```
mklink /d <path to React Seed project>\chartiq\js <path to extracted ChartIQ library>\js
mklink /d <path to React Seed project>\chartiq\css <path to extracted ChartIQ library>\css
```

Using symlinks is not required. If preferred the js and css from the charting library can be copied and pasted into these directories (<react_seed_dir>/chartiq/js and css respectively)

### Running Locally

You will need to install the project's dependencies and build the distribution file by running the following command from the project's root:

```
npm install
```

Once you have that, run ```npm start``` and open your browser window to localhost port 3000 to view the fully working example.

## Customizing

*Note: We do not recommend using the web components from template-advanced.html within frameworks. Unless you have very advanced skills, you are better off building framework components that interface with the charting library.*

All of the project source is in the `src` folder. The main ChartIQ charting component is in src/components/Chart.jsx. This file is connected to a redux store inside of src/containers/chartContainer.js. Whenever the chartReducer pushes a state change, the ChartContainer component will catch the new data and pass the ciq object to the UI elements so they can update according the state of the chart. When the chart container mounts it calls a redux action which creates a new stx object from the charting library, and passes the chartContainer node to it. 

```
case Types.SET_CONTAINER:
      let ciq = new CIQ.ChartEngine({
        container: action.container
      })
      ciq.attachQuoteFeed(state.service, { refreshInterval: state.refreshInterval })
      ciq.setMarketFactory(CIQ.Market.Symbology.factory);
      // new CIQ.ExtendedHours({stx:stxx, filter:true});
      ciq.newChart(state.symbol)
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        ciq: ciq
      })
```

If you desire to manage state outside of the redux support provided 'out-of-the-box', the UI elements provided are available to build a UI/wrapper around your own charting node where you can create and manage a ChartEngine instance elsewhere.

## Building for use in the browser

This project is using Webpack to transform JSX and ES6 to ES5. The configs for this are in the `webpack.config.js`.
Running `npm run build` from the command line will re-create the distribution file `dist/chartIQ.js`.
This is a transformed and bundled version of everything in the src directory. `src/index.js` will automatically load this file.

*NOTE: Currently this project does not run in IE11*
